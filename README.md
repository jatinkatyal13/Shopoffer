# Shopoffer

## Introduction

### Shopoffer is an android app based on the IOT (Internet of Things) concept made for Beacathon - Hacathon conducted by Coding Ninjas held on 29th December 2016. The main idea behind this app was to make shopping in malls more interesting and make people aware about the offers all the time from the moment they enter in a mall till the moment they leave the mall.

## Working and Idea

### The main proposal was that each shop has it's own beacon installed and we have app installed in our phone which recieve data from beacon installed in each shop as the user get close to that shop while moving around the shops in the mall. In this way the user get updated in real time about all the offers going on in different shops and he/she can have a hassle free shopping experience.
